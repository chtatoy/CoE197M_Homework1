Homework 1:
Remove projective distortion on a given image
at least 4pts on target image known


Note:

> Make sure "pictures" folder is in same folder location as main and functions code

Steps:

1. Run "python.exe main.py"

2. Select four points corresponding to a planar section 
   such that rectangle if no projective distortion
      x4 <----- x3                  x4'<----- x3'
     /         /                     |         |
    /         /                      |         |
   x1 -----> x2                     x1'-----> x2'

3. Wait for undistorted image to load
