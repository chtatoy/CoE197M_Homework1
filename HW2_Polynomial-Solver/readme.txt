Objective 

SGD is a useful algorithm with many applications. In this assignment, we will use SGD in the TinyGrad framework as polynomial solver - to find the degree and coefficients.

Usage:

The application will be used as follows:

python3 solver.py

The solver will use data_train.csv to estimate the degree and coefficients of a polynomial. To test the generalization of the learned function, it should have small test error on data_test.csv.

The function should be modeled using tinygrad : https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad

Use SGD to learned the polynomial coefficients.
